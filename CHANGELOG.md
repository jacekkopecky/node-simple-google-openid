# Change log

## 0.2.x

- made CLIENT ID required (changed default behaviour)
  - without CLIENT ID, the server would accept ID tokens for any app, not just for yours
  - so any app owner could impersonate their users in your app
- 0.2.1: added status to README

## 0.1.0

- works for me, does what I need
- let me know if it doesn't work for you
